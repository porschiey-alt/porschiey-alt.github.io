        <p>Hello! January flew by&hellip; and what with my actual job picking back up, my velocity on Parchment slowed down a bit.

<h2 id="beauty-corner-mountains">Beauty corner: Mountains</h2>

<p>I spent a majority of my time this month on mountains, and I hope the work is showing! I&rsquo;m quite pleased with the progress, given I&rsquo;m not an artist <em>at all</em>. That being said, they are far from perfect and I have spent way too many days just sitting at my desk trying to fine tune them for little gain. So for now, I&rsquo;m moving on and I will likely come back around to work on them later.</p>
<h2 id="beauty-corner-trees">Beauty corner: Trees</h2>
<p>Since mountains got some love, I decided it was time for the trees to get an upgrade as well. They now have a richer green color, they have variety baked in, and if you look closely, they have a slight wind effect to give them life. <em><strong>Check out the clip below - can you see them wiggle?</strong></em></p>

<h2 id="report-server-tech-playtest">Report: Server tech playtest</h2>
<p>In January we released a build to friends and family to validate the initial network technology. We launched a realm called <code>Hightower</code> and let players sign and mess around. Although attendance was low (&lt;10), no one reported any server or network issues. This is a massive win for me, given all the heavy work put into the server tech ahead of time. (See <a href="posts/building-world-never-sleeps/">Building a world that never sleeps</a>). Naturally, a low amount of connected clients at sporadic times hardly tests and validates the entire stack. For that we&rsquo;ll need hundreds more and plenty of &ldquo;soak time&rdquo;. But it is a win nonetheless to see brand new tech not fall over when the first computer that isn&rsquo;t mine connect to it. It was even more satisfying to have a massive battle against my co-developer&hellip; and have him obliterate me.</p>
<h2 id="unit-pathing">Unit Pathing</h2>
<p>Pathfinding v1 has been added to the game! This might not seem like much, and perhaps a rather trivial addition, but it is more complicated than that, unfortunately. Most game developers are likely to use Unity&rsquo;s built in Navmesh and navigation - where you bake in the terrain, specify game objects that are obstacles, and let Unity do the hard work for you.</p>
<p><strong>We don&rsquo;t have that luxury.</strong> Why? Well, two primary reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The map is procedurally generated on demand, so we cannot pre-bake the navigation.</li>
<li>Our server tech tells the client its path, not the other way around. The server must make this calculation. But our server is not a headless unity executable running the game as a dedicated server. We have a completely different netstack.</li>
</ol>
<p>This means the server that runs the entire realm must also calculate the pathfinding. Luckily, it&rsquo;s set up for just a scenario. The player&rsquo;s own &ldquo;worker bee&rdquo; (again see previous blogs) calculates the path and sends the result to the &ldquo;queen bee&rdquo; that runs the realm to minimize disruption and compute.</p>
<p><img src="/images/unitPathing.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There are still some limitations we&rsquo;ll work through - such as traveling over super long distances, but I&rsquo;m quite pleased with v1.</p>
<h2 id="for-february">For February</h2>
<p>Our working plans for February are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to improve the look and feel of the game, adding and fine tuning the art pieces and smoothing out rough edges.</li>
<li>Improve city/base expansion experience. More buildings you construct will appear outside the center city unit.</li>
<li>Improve combat display. Combat panel display bugs will be sorted and multiple visual improvements will be added.</li>
<li>Create stacking logic. Units can no longer stack unless certain conditions are met, and travel in and arrive in formation.</li>
<li>Finalize our starting capsule art.</li>
</ul>
<p>See you in a month!</p>
